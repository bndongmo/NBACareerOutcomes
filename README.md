# README for Basketball Player Career Outcome Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the career outcomes of basketball players based on their early career statistics. The project uses machine learning techniques and data analysis to determine the likelihood of a player reaching various career milestones, such as becoming an All-Star, an elite player, or falling out of the league.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preparation**: The project starts by importing and cleaning the necessary data from CSV files. Three main datasets are used: player statistics, team statistics, and player awards data.

2. **Analysis and Data Cleaning**: Data is analyzed, and some cleaning is performed to ensure data consistency. Player names with variations are standardized, and missing values are handled.

3. **Part 1: Awards Analysis**: The first part of the project focuses on analyzing awards data. It answers questions like the average points per game for players who received All-NBA and All-Star honors between 2007 and 2021.

4. **Part 2: Experience Analysis**: This part answers questions related to the average number of years of experience required for players to achieve their first All-NBA selection.

5. **Part 3: Career Outcomes Classification**: Career outcomes are categorized into six buckets: Elite, All-Star, Starter, Rotation, Roster, and Out of the League. This section classifies players based on these career outcomes.

6. **Building a Model**: A machine learning model is developed to predict career outcomes based on early career statistics. The model uses logistic regression and is trained on data from players who started their careers between 2007 and 2015.

7. **Strengths and Weaknesses**: The strengths and weaknesses of the developed model are discussed, including potential areas for improvement.

## Data
The project utilizes player statistics, team statistics, and player awards data. These datasets provide valuable insights into the performance and achievements of basketball players.

## Analysis and Insights
The project provides insights into various aspects of basketball player careers, such as the average points per game for award-winning players, the time it takes to achieve All-NBA selection, and the classification of career outcomes.

## Model and Predictions
A logistic regression model is used to predict career outcomes. It takes early career statistics as input and provides probabilities for players falling into different career buckets. The model is trained on data from players drafted between 2007 and 2015.

## Project Extensions
The project can be extended to include more advanced machine learning models, additional data sources, or features like player age and career trajectory to improve prediction accuracy.
